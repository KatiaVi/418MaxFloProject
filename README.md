# 418MaxFloProject
Parallel and Sequential implementations of Dinic's, Push-Relabel and Genetic algorithms for solving the graph maxflow problem.

Todo (for Katia):
Sequential Genetic Algorithm:
1. Finish Implementing functions for sequential genetic version
2. Create Makefile to run compile the genetic sequential code
3. Create a main function to run the sequential genetic solver from
4. Create a small test case to run the genetic sequential code on
5. (Discuss with Wynne) Re-evaluate the design choices made (class types, functions, private/public variables)
6. Try to hook up a larger test case (from our actual workload)
7. Run Sequential algorithm for larger test case + debug any issues
8. Create tester/modify Makefile? to add timer to evaluate speed of algo
8. Tune the sequential algorithm for performance
